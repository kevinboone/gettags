# gettags -- a simple utility for reading tags from MP3, Ogg, FLAC, M4A, and M4B files (and maybe others)</h1>

Version 0.2b

**Note**

This is old code. I maintain it just enough that I can use if for my own
purposes. Although `gettags` is a self-contained utility, the utility really
exists as a test framework for the tag-reading library, which is container
in two C files: `tag_reader.h` and `tag_reader.c`.  

There are better tag-reading libraries and utilities than this.  `gettags`
exists, and I contininue to maintain it, solely because it has no additional
dependencies, which makes it easy to use in other code. I use it in all my
embedded media applications. 

I'm open to bug reports, so long as they contain enough
information for me to reproduce the problem. However, this utility works
well enough for my own purposes, and I won't be putting a whole lot of
effort into maintaining it.

## What is this?

`gettags` is a simple, completely self-contained command-line utility for
reading metadata tags from audio files. At present it supports  MP3 (ID3v2),
Ogg and FLAC (with Vorbis-style comments), and MP4 (M4A, M4B).  I might add
other file types if I ever accumulate enough file in those formats to make
it worth the effort. Note that file names and extensions are irrelevant to
this utility -- `gettags` will try to extract tags in all the formats it
understands. Consequently, some file types may work even though I have never
tested them. 

The main purpose of `gettags` is to make it straightforward to write shell
or perl scripts that move music files around according to their tags.
Although there are plenty of command-line utilities that will read the
contents of tags, they typically work only with one type of file. gettags
only extracts a relatively small set of tags, but it does it in the same way
across all file types it supports. 

gettags is written entirely in ANSI C, with no dependencies on any other
libraries. It can be compiled for Linux, or for Windows using either Cygwin
or MinGW.  The complete tag reader code is contained in one (rather long and
unattractive) C source file and one header file, so it should be easy to
incorporate the tag reader into other C/C++ applications.

## Basic usage

To display all (text) tags in a file:

```
% gettags {filename}
```

This will display tags with their "native" names. So, for example, in ID3v2
the tag that is usually interpreted as the track title is `TIT2`.  In MP4
this tag is `nam`.


To display just the title tag, if it is present:

```
% gettags -c title {filename}
```

To display the specific TALB tag in an MP3 file, if it is present:

```
% gettags -e TALB {filename}
```

## Building

There is a Makefile that should work on Linux-like systems, including
Cygwin.

    make
    sudo make install

There is a variable `DEBUG` in the Makefile; when set to '1' the 
build will produce a binary with full debug symbols included. 

There is a completely unrelated debug flag `tag_debug` in `tag_reader.c`.
When set to TRUE, the program will output additional debugging information
at runtime.

## Script mode

In 'script' mode, which is enabled with the `-s` switch, all output from
gettags is prefixed with either 'OK' or 'ERROR'. This is intended to make it
easier for scripts to distinguish valid responses from error responses.
However, because all valid output is to `stdout`, and error messages are to
`stderr`, it might be easier just to take the absence of any response on
`stdout` as an indication of an error. For examle, in perl:


```perl
my $album = `gettags -c album "$file"`;
chomp ($album);
if ($album)
  {
  # There is an album tag, so continue...
  }
else
  {
  die "No album tag in $file\n".
  }
```

## Common tags

The difference between `-e` and `-c` is significant.  `-e` specifies an
exact name. The tag will only be displayed if its exact match is found (case
sensitive). However, there is no uniformity at all between the tag naming
conventions in the different file types.  In fact, there's little uniformity
between tagging applications even within the same file type, but there's not
much that I can do about that.

To make it possible to work on mixed file types with the same script,
gettags provides simple names for the various tags which are common to most
audio file formats.  For example, the argument `-c album` will extract a tag
call 'album', 'talb', 'alb', or 'tal', regardless of case. 'TAL' and 'TALB'
are the names used within the various releases of the ID3v2 specification;
'Album', or 'ALBUM' are usually used with Ogg and FLAC files; 'alb' is used
in MP4 and other QuickTime derivatives.

The argument `-c artist` will match (regardless of case) 'TP1', 'TPE1',
'artist', 'art' or 'performer'. The latter is necessary because there is
some disagreement about how to name the primary artist in FLAC tags.
'album-artist' is a rather non-standard tag that seems to have been
introduced by Apple. It corresponds to the tag 'aART' in MP4/M4A/M4B, and
TPE2 in MP3. The use of TPE2 for this purpose is not particularly
widespread.

To get a list of supported common tag name, run:

```
% gettags -c help
```


## Cover art

Use the argument `-o {file\_root}` to extract a cover art image,
if there is one. Do not provide a filename extension -- the program will
write an extension appropriate to the type of the image. If multiple images
are present in the file, only the first is extracted.

## Unicode issues

ID3v2 allows for a variety of different Unicode formats, even within the
same file. Ogg, FLAC, M4A, and M4B use 8-bit characters, which in practice
usually means UTF-8 --  there does not seem to be any way to specify an
encoding in any of these formats.

To unify functionality across file types, all output from `gettags` is
encoded as UTF-8, regardless of the original encoding.  This is nearly
always the best way to represent text data in modern computer systems --
UTF-8 is widely supported, and is automatically detected by the majority of
applications that handle text. Most importantly from a programming/scripting
perspective, UTF-8 will never contain embedded zero bytes, so UTF-8 strings
can often be handled just like ASCII.

## Limitations

1. `gettags` can't do anything about incorrectly formatted tags. For
  example, if the encoder says that a tag is in UTF-8 format, but actually
  puts UTF-16 into the tag, that's too bad. This happens surprisingly often.

2. It's possible for badly-formatted tags to crash `gettags`.  If you come
  across one of these, please send it to me so I can improve the program.

3. `gettags` only handles text tags, ID3v2 comments (which are a variety of
  text tag), and cover art images. Any other tags that are not known to be
  printable text are ignored. 

4. If there are multiple tags with the same name, all will be extracted.
  This could be a problem for scripts that are expecting a single line
  response.

5. `gettags` does not support ID3v1 tags, because I don't think anybody
  still uses them.

## Example usage in a script

This example shows a simple perl script that renames a bunch of music files
according to the tags they contain. In practice, the process might be more
complicated than this, because a real script would have to deal with issues
such as illegal characters in filenames, or duplicate titles.

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

# A script that uses gettags to copy a bunch of music files to a new directory
# whose name is given by ${target_dir}/${album}/${title}/${extension}
# Where $target_dir is the first argument to the script, $title and
# $album are taken from the music file, and $extension is the original file
# extension
#
# Example:
#
# move_album.pl /media/my_albums /tmp/my_cd_rips/*.mp3

use strict;

die "Usage: move_album.pl {directory} {files...}" if (scalar(@ARGV) < 1);

my $target_dir = $ARGV[0];
print "target=", $target_dir, "\n";

system ("mkdir -p \"$target_dir\"");

for (my $i = 1; $i < scalar(@ARGV); $i++)
  {
  my $file = $ARGV[$i];
  my $album = `gettags -c album "$file"`;
  chomp ($album);
  if ($album)
    {
    my $title = `gettags -c title "$file"`;
    chomp ($title);
    if ($title)
      {
      my $ext = ($file =~ m/([^.]+)$/)[0];
      my $album_dir = "${target_dir}/${album}";
      my $target_file = "${album_dir}/${title}.${ext}";
      system ("mkdir -p \"${album_dir}\"");
      print "Copying file ", $file, "\n to ", $target_file, "\n";
      my $cmd = "cp \"$file\" \"$target_file\""; 
      system ($cmd);
      }
    }
  else
    {
    print "No album tag in '", $file, "\n";
    }
  }
```

## Bugs

If you find an MP3, FLAC, M4A, M4B, or Ogg file that gettags does not handle
correctly, please let me know.

## History

0.2b May 2024 
Fixed a nasty bug that arose when trying to parse something as an MP4 file,
that wasn't actually in MP4 format.
